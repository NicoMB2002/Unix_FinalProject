## Project

### Initial option
Originally we were trying to design a project that would contribute to FLOSS, and it would be a Backup System that would automate backups and 
log every time a backup was executed. For this we were planning on using 'Restic', an Open-Source project that allowed contributions. 
Unfortunately this was a bit ambitious for us, and also given the time we had, we opted for another project idea which is the current
"Website Auto-Deployment Project".


## Hosting Providers

For the hosting providers we had multiple options provieded by the teacher:

- https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/vps/
- https://buyvm.net/kvm-dedicated-server-slices/
- https://www.ionos.ca/servers/vps
- https://www.lunanode.com/pricing
- https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#basic-droplets


Initially we didn't know which opion would be best, but since we were searching for a basic and cheap option we chose LunaNode.
