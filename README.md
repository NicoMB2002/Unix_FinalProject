**AutoDeploy-Server** is a reliable auto-deployment system for Linux web servers.  
It automatically updates the live website every time a commit is pushed to the Git repository.

In addition to automated deployment, it monitors the serverâ€™s status to ensure consistent performance.  
The system supports:
- Automatic website deployment via Git
- Log generation
- Email notifications in case of backup failures
