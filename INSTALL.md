# This is the Step-By-Step to recreate this Project:

## First
First research your prefered VPS (Virtual Private Server) for your needs. For this type of project a very basic server should suffice.
Once a VPS is acquired it will serve as the place where everything will run.
Once You set that up, you can go ahead and install Nginx, which is the server to deploy your website to the internet. Nginx can serve
static and dynamic content, handling requests from web browsers and other clients. The VPS will keep it running 24/7 and make sure
it's available to access by everyone.

## Second

Create bash scripts to:
1. Update the server every time a commit is pushed to te repo.
2. Send email notifications to a every admin user every time a change is made.


## Third

Ensure your server is secure by creating a firewall for it.
